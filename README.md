## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Apart from the standard stack of libraries included in Anaconda two other Python libraries were used and possibly need to be installed:
- missingno
- imblearn. 

The code should run with no issues using Python 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
I was interested in the job adverts data to understand what characteristics determine an offer to be a fraudulent one.
There are several questions that are in the scope of this analysis:

    Which countries have the largest ratio of fraudulent job adverts?
    Do fraudulent job US listings offer higher salary than genuine ones?
    What industries are profitable in the US?
    What types of employment do the scammers prefer?
    Is it possible to create an accurate classification model to detect scam job offers with simple feature engineering?

## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
 
1. Fraudulent job adverts.ipynb - jupyter notebook with exploratory data analysis and model
